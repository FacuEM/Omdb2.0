# OMDB 2.0

This project is about recreating the imdb website using the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) api. This is the second time I do this project, the first was: https://github.com/FacuEM/24-OMDB. In this I focus on making a cleaner code and implement react hooks. As additional features to bring the movies by name, there is also an administrator user who has the ability to see all registered users in the application and as a normal user can add, view and delete favorite movies. I also use passport to validate the registration and login of a new user.

## how to initialize the project?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FacuEM/Omdb2.0.git
```
## FRONT 
```bash
cd Omdb2.0/front  
npm install
npm run build
```
## BACK 
```bash
cd Omdb2.0/front  
npm install
npm start
```
